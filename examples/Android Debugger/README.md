# Android Debugger

This example Unity project is somewhat simular to the [Unity Screen Bars example](https://github.com/zeh/unity-screen-bars/tree/master/examples/Unity%20Screen%20Bars%20Example) project, but with additional methods and some user interface to expose the values of Android's UI flags while . As such, this example is only useful when debugging those flags.

For a better example on how to use the Unity Screen Bars library, please use the main example, [Unity Screen Bars example](https://github.com/zeh/unity-screen-bars/tree/master/examples/Unity%20Screen%20Bars%20Example). For more information Unity Screen Bars itself, including reference documentation, please check [the repository root](https://github.com/zeh/unity-screen-bars).
